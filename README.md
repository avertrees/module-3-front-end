## MapBox App
A single-page application that allows users to interact with a map.

## Features
Users are able to view everyoneâ€™s pins on the map. When a user clicks on the map, a pin is added to the map at the location. Each pin is represented by a circular image. When a user clicks on an image, a popup marker is displayed with the details about that location and the option to delete, edit, and like that pin. Users can edit the title, description, and image URL. 

## Motivation
This project was created to gain experience working with interactive Maps.
